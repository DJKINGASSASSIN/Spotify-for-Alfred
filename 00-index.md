Taking a look at <strong>Spotifious</strong>, eh? The natural
Spotify controller for Alfred? Well, it's right here, and
I think you'll like it.

<strong>Spotifious</strong> makes it <em>fun</em> to use
Spotify. It's smart, fast, and powerful, and installs in
2 minutes. It's the most natural way to control your music.
And my mom thinks it's pretty cool.

<h2>Features</h2>

	<h3>A controller, not a workflow</h3>
	<p>
		It's easy to make an Alfred workflow. But keeping it
		coherent as its power grows? That's hard. Spotifious
		makes it look easy, no matter what you do.

	<h3>Alfred-like</h3>
	<p>
		Of course, Spotifious is also Alfred-like. Spotifious
		makes <em>sense</em> when you use it. Just start
		typing to search Spotify. Browse through artists and
		albums like it's nothing with snappy context-based
		search, and control Spotify in a way that makes sense.
		Your frequent searches rise to the top, and your
		controls are brought to you by the letter <kbd>c</kbd>.

	<h3>Smart</h3>
	<p>
		Spotify updates with Packal, so you don't have to
		worry. It gives you a heads-up about what's playing
		<em>the moment you start it.</em> And don't worry
		about errors&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;we'll handle those.
