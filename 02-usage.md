Don't worry! This is gonna be a snap.

Assuming you've [downloaded & installed][dl] the workflow, now what?

[dl]: {{site.baseurl}}/download "Download & install the workflow using this guide"

1. Press `^⌘⏎`

Good! You should see a brief loading entry, then the main menu:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/loading.png)
![]({{site.baseurl}}/img/main_menu.png)

Now you are free to type to search, type `c` to access the control panel, `s` to access settings, or bind other key commands in Alfred workflow settings.
