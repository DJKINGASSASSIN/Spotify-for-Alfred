Installation is gosh-darned simple. Follow these instructions and you'll be
happier than a fourth-grader at recess.

It's a two-part process, but it shouldn't take all of 5 minutes.

## Download the thingy

1. Download the [latest version][latest] of Spotifious.
2. Open `Spotifious.alfredworkflow` by double-clicking it or dragging it
	into Alfred.
3. **Bind the launcher hotkey**:
	3. Double-click the first thingy marked `Hotkey`.
	4. Click the text field labeled `Hotkey` and press `^⌘⏎`.
	5. Click `Save` to store the binding.
4. Bind the other hotkeys as you wish. Their actions are visible in the `Text`
	field, under `Argument`
5. Pop up Spotifious with the key command you set— I would have `^⌘⏎`
