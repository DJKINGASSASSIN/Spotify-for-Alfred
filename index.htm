				Taking a look at <strong>Spotifious</strong>, eh? The natural
				Spotify controller for Alfred? Well, it's right here, and
				I think you'll like it.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Spotifious</strong> makes it <em>fun</em> to use
				Spotify. It's smart, fast, and powerful, and installs in
				2 minutes. It's the most natural way to control your music.
				And my mom thinks it's pretty cool.

			<h2>Features</h2>

			<p>Here're some things that make it special:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>A controller, not a workflow</strong>

					<p>
						It's easy to make an Alfred workflow. But keeping it
						coherent as its power grows? That's hard. Spotifious
						makes it look easy, even as you drill through Queen's
						bajillion albums, and even if something goes wrong.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Alfred-like</strong>

					<p>
						Of course, Spotifious is also Alfred-like. Spotifious
						makes <em>sense</em> when you use it. Just start
						typing to search Spotify. Browse through artists and
						albums like it's nothing with snappy context-based
						search, and control Spotify in a way that makes sense.
						Your frequent searches rise to the top, and your
						controls are brought to you by the letter <kbd>c</kbd>
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<strong>Smart</strong>
					<p>
						Spotify updates with Packal, so you don't have to
						worry. It gives you a heads-up about what's playing
						<em>the moment you start it.</em> And don't worry
						about errors&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;we'll handle those.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
